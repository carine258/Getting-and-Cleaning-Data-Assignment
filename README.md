This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera
course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.  Download the dataset.
2.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Use
    commande rbind to combine training and test set.
3.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
4.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activitiesin the data
    set.
5.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variables names.
6.  From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

tidydata.txt is the exported final data after going through all the
sequences described above.

CodeBook.md a code that describes the variables, the data, and any
transformations or work that i performed to clean up the data
